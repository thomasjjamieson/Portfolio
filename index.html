                <li><b>About Me:</b></li>
                <p>Hello! I’m Thomas Jamieson, originally from small town Fallon, Nevada. Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Computer and Electrical Engineering at Brigham Young University-Idaho. I’m passionate about the endless possibilities that programming offers, and I’m excited about where my professional journey will lead. I’ve been happily married for over two years, and my wife and I have a wonderful little boy. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports, particularly tennis and pickleball, and I love spending time with family playing card, board, and video games.<br></p>
                <li><b>Projects:</b></li>
                <p>I have made several projects, but I'm most proud of my project 'Remember Words'. Simply put it is a dynamic list that helps the user learn how to spell words that they struggle with. Here is a video that I made that shows the functionally of the application:<br>

            <p>
                Nevada is a desert, most of the land is owned by the government, and it has sagebrush. This is where I called home for the first 18 year of my life. I loved it there. My area of Nevada never got too hot or too cold. I had family all around me and enjoyed many outdoor activities.
